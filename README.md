Hi, I’m @Hymashiwelida.

I'm in my final year studying Human Resource Management in Singapore University of Social Studies.
Having taken Business Analytics as my minor course, my interest in analytics and coding grew and here I am! 

In my free time, I enjoy reading manga; watching random shows (including cat videos); and when I have some funds to spare, bouldering!
I’m currently learning Python when I have the time and SAS Programming for a module in school :)

I'm very much a novice in this new world I've just placed myself in, so I'll appreciate any help I can get! 
My most advanced code is probably the Hangman game from 12 Beginner Python Projects by freecodecamp.org on YouTube, hosted by Kylie Ying... haha...
